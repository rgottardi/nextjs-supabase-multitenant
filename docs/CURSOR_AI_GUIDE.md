## Effective Prompting Strategies

### Code Generation
1. **Be Specific and Detailed**
   ```
   "Create a React component that handles form validation for email and password inputs, 
   including error messages and submission handling. Use TypeScript and follow React best practices."
   ```

2. **Include Context**
   ```
   "Given our current authentication setup using Supabase, create a sign-up form 
   component that integrates with our existing auth flow. Include error handling 
   and loading states."
   ```

3. **Specify Requirements**
   ```
   "Create a utility function that:
   - Accepts an array of objects
   - Filters based on multiple criteria
   - Sorts by specified field
   - Returns paginated results
   Include TypeScript types and JSDoc documentation."
   ```

### Code Explanation
1. **Request Specific Details**
   ```
   "Explain this useEffect hook's dependency array and potential side effects. 
   What improvements could be made for better performance?"
   ```

2. **Ask for Best Practices**
   ```
   "Review this authentication logic and suggest improvements based on security 
   best practices. Consider error handling and edge cases."
   ```

### Code Refactoring
1. **Provide Clear Goals**
   ```
   "Refactor this component to use React Query for data fetching, 
   implementing proper loading and error states. Maintain existing functionality."
   ```

2. **Specify Constraints**
   ```
   "Optimize this function for performance while maintaining readability. 
   Focus on reducing unnecessary re-renders and memory usage."
   ```

## Best Practices

### Project Organization
1. **Create Reference Prompts**
   - Store common prompts in `.md` files
   - Reference them in your prompts
   - Maintain consistency across team

2. **Document AI Interactions**
   - Keep track of generated code
   - Document AI decisions
   - Share learning with team

### Code Quality
1. **Review Generated Code**
   - Always verify AI suggestions
   - Test edge cases
   - Check for security issues
   - Validate performance implications

2. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Start with broad prompts
   - Refine based on results
   - Be specific about improvements
   - Maintain code style consistency

## Advanced Techniques

### Custom Prompts Library
```markdown
# Component Generation
template: Create a [type] component that handles [functionality].
Include:
- TypeScript types
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Unit tests
- Documentation

# Code Review
template: Review this [feature] implementation for:
- Performance issues
- Security concerns
- Best practices
- Potential bugs
- Improvement opportunities
```

### Context Enhancement
1. **Project-Specific Context**
   ```
   "Consider our multi-tenant architecture and compliance requirements when 
   generating this database access layer."
   ```

2. **Framework Context**
   ```
   "Using Next.js 14 App Router and Server Components, create a data fetching 
   utility that implements proper caching and revalidation."
   ```

## Common Patterns

### Error Resolution
1. **Provide Full Context**
   ```
   "I'm getting this error: [error message]
   Here's the relevant code: [code snippet]
   I've tried: [previous attempts]
   Environment: [version info]"
   ```

2. **Step-by-Step Debugging**
   ```
   "Walk through this code execution step by step, identifying potential issues 
   at each stage. Focus on [specific concern]."
   ```

### Feature Development
1. **Planning Phase**
   ```
   "Help me plan the implementation of [feature] considering:
   - Data structure
   - API design
   - Component architecture
   - State management
   - Error handling"
   ```

2. **Implementation Phase**
   ```
   "Based on our planning, implement the [component/feature] starting with 
   the core functionality. Follow TDD principles."
   ```

## Tips for Specific Tasks

### Database Operations
```
"Generate a Supabase query that:
- Implements proper type safety
- Includes error handling
- Follows security best practices
- Optimizes for performance"
```

### API Development
```
"Create an API route handler that:
- Validates input
- Handles authentication
- Implements rate limiting
- Returns proper status codes
- Includes error handling"
```

### Testing
```
"Generate test cases for this authentication flow covering:
- Happy path
- Error cases
- Edge cases
- Security scenarios
- Performance considerations"
```
