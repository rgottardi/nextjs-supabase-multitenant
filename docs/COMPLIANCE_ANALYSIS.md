# Multi-Tenant Compliance Analysis for Medical Device Software

This document analyzes the compliance requirements for our multi-tenant architecture against 21 CFR Part 11, ISO 9001, and ISO 13485 standards, and outlines necessary changes.

## 21 CFR Part 11 Requirements Impact

### Electronic Records
**Current Gap**: Our audit trail implementation isn't comprehensive enough

**Needed Changes**:
- Implement system-wide audit logging with user, timestamp, and reason for change
- Ensure records show original and modified data
- Add electronic signature functionality with dual authentication
- Implement record version control and archival system

### Access Controls
**Current Gap**: Basic role-based access isn't sufficient

**Needed Changes**:
- Implement authority checks for each signature
- Add system documentation for access level assignments
- Create user-specific authentication tokens
- Enforce password complexity and expiration

### System Validation
**Current Gap**: Lack of formal validation documentation

**Needed Changes**:
- Create Installation Qualification (IQ) documentation
- Implement Operational Qualification (OQ) procedures
- Add Performance Qualification (PQ) tests
- Document validation protocol for each tenant

## ISO 9001 Requirements Impact

### Quality Management System
**Current Gap**: Insufficient process documentation

**Needed Changes**:
- Implement document control system
- Add quality metrics tracking
- Create process for handling non-conformities
- Set up management review procedures

### Documentation
**Current Gap**: Insufficient system documentation

**Needed Changes**:
- Create comprehensive system documentation
- Implement document version control
- Add document approval workflows
- Set up document retention policies

## ISO 13485 Additional Requirements

### Risk Management
**Current Gap**: No formal risk management system

**Needed Changes**:
- Implement risk assessment for each feature
- Create risk management documentation
- Add risk control measures
- Set up risk monitoring system

### Data Integrity
**Current Gap**: Basic data validation only

**Needed Changes**:
- Implement checksums for data integrity
- Add data verification procedures
- Create data backup validation
- Set up data recovery testing

## Required Architecture Changes

### Database Layer
- Use schema-per-tenant instead of RLS for stronger isolation
- Implement comprehensive audit logging at the database level
- Add data encryption at rest
- Create separate backup strategies per tenant

### Application Layer
- Implement validated system controls
- Add electronic signature functionality
- Create comprehensive audit trail system
- Implement document control system

### Infrastructure
- Set up validated environments (Development, QA, Production)
- Implement change control procedures
- Add infrastructure qualification process
- Create disaster recovery validation

## Required Additional Features

### Compliance Module
- Electronic signature capture and verification
- Comprehensive audit trail viewer
- Document control system
- Validation report generation

### Validation Suite
- Test case management
- Validation protocol execution
- Requirements traceability matrix
- Validation documentation generation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Changes
- Implement comprehensive audit trail

### Infrastructure Updates
- Move to validated hosting environment
- Implement backup validation
- Add disaster recovery testing
- Create change control system

### Process Changes
- Create validation protocol
- Implement risk management
- Add quality management system
- Set up management review process

## Development Impact
